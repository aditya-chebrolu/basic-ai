In a small coastal village nestled between rugged cliffs and the restless sea, the townspeople prepared for the annual Lantern Festival. Every year, they crafted hundreds of paper lanterns, each one representing a hope or memory, and released them into the sky at twilight. This tradition, dating back centuries, was believed to bring peace to the spirits of the past and blessings to the living.

Among the villagers was Mira, a young girl who had never missed a festival. This year, however, her excitement was tinged with sorrow—her grandfather, a beloved storyteller, had passed away just weeks earlier. Determined to honor him, she spent days crafting the most intricate lantern she had ever made, adorned with scenes from his favorite tales.

When the evening came and the first lanterns began to rise, Mira lit hers and whispered a quiet goodbye. As it drifted skyward, glowing softly against the dusk, she felt a gentle breeze brush her cheek—like the touch of her grandfather’s hand.
